                    <h3>Professional Background</h3>
                    <p>I'm a software engineering student from Indonesia, currently studying at Xiamen University
                        Malaysia. My Surabayan roots have shaped my unique communication style, often mixing Indonesian
                        with Javanese and featuring that distinct "medok" tone.</p>
                    <p>I'm passionate about backend development and data management, with a focus on creating efficient
                        and scalable systems.</p>

                    <h3>Cultural Background</h3>
                    <p>Being from Surabaya, Indonesia, I bring a unique cultural perspective to my work and
                        interactions. The "medok" accent from my hometown adds character to my communication style, and
                        I embrace the blend of languages that forms my identity.</p>
                    <p>This multicultural experience helps me approach problems from different angles and collaborate
                        effectively in diverse environments.</p>
